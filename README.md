# Introduction 
This repository holds the analysis of market price data. 

## Problem statement 
Local herders in southern kenya encounter challenges in deciding when to sell their livestock, often influenced by climate extreme like drought, household needs among others. The resulting delay in decision making can lead to substantial livelihood losses including livestock death during extreme droughts. 

## Objectives 
1. Perform exploratory Data analysis to guide model fitting process. 
2. Utilize attached market price data for livestock to fit a model of our choice
3. Determine the advanatges and disadvantages of selling at a specific point i.e to demonstrate the benefits of selling earlier to mitigate price decline resulting from drought.   

## Product development
The attached [Rmarkdown](./Results_Lena.RMD) file has achieved the above objectives. In addition to that I have developed and deployed a User friendly application to showcase monthly price prediction.
## Deployment
The application was published to rshiny on the following [link](https://lenaanyango.shinyapps.io/MarketPrices/)
